# WebAssembly Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) Proposal

### INTRODUCTION:
This project describes how to build the LLVM/Clang WebAssembly compiler and linker as is
(currently based on Linux) and use this project to build a set of initial tests that 
will determine and standardize on the definitions of WebAssembly instructions.

The Makefile can make a disassembly of the intrinsics for evaluation.  This is done by
doing the following:

make disasm

## PREREQUISITES:
* Linux/Windows (in the future)

### REQUIREMENTS:
* Ninja build environment
* git/svn/clang

### INSTALLATION:
* Ubuntu
* Windows

## FILES:

```
Makefile
Readme.md
WebAssemblyIntrinsic.cpp
WebAssemblyIntrinsic.h

## IMPLEMENTATIONS:

```

### Build files:

```
Makefile
(in the future a Windows make vcproj ?)

### WEBASSEMBLY:

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
**Windows:**

**Linux:**		

```
Set the environment path for the clang++ compiler as well as the 
Ninja build environment.

```
**WebAssembly (Test):**

```
