# WebAssembly Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) Proposal

### INTRODUCTION:
This project describes how to build the LLVM/Clang WebAssembly compiler and linker as is
(currently based on Linux) and use this project to build a set of initial tests that 
will determine and standardize on the definitions of WebAssembly instructions.

## PREREQUISITES:
* Linux/Windows (in the future)

### REQUIREMENTS:
* Ninja build environment
* git/svn/clang

### INSTALLATION:
* Ubuntu
